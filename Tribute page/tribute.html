    <p><b style="color: rgb(146, 215, 235);">Narendra Damodardas Modi</b> (Gujarati: [ˈnəɾendɾə dɑmodəɾˈdɑs ˈmodiː] (listen);<b>born
            17 September 1950</b>
        )[b] is
        an
        Indian politician serving as the 14th and current prime minister of India since May 2014. Modi was the chief
        minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament from Varanasi. He is a member of the
        Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu nationalist
        paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest-serving prime minister from outside the Indian National
        Congress.</p>
    <p>Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary education. He was
        introduced to the RSS at age eight. He has reminisced about helping out after school at his father's tea stall
        at the Vadnagar railway station, a description not reliably corroborated. At age 18, he was married to
        Jashodaben Modi, whom he abandoned soon after. He first publicly acknowledged her as his wife more than four
        decades later when required to do so by Indian law, but has made no contact with her since. Modi has asserted he
        had travelled in northern India for two years after leaving his parental home, visiting a number of religious
        centres, but few details of his travels have emerged. Upon his return to Gujarat in 1971, he became a full-time
        worker for the RSS. After the state of emergency was declared by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1975, he went
        into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy
        until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.[c]

        Modi was appointed chief minister of Gujarat in 2001 due to Keshubhai Patel's failing health and poor public
        image following the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His
        administration has been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots in which 1044 people were killed,
        three-quarters of whom were Muslim,[d] or otherwise criticised for its management of the crisis. A Special
        Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings
        against him personally.[e] While his policies as chief minister—credited with encouraging economic growth—have
        received praise, his administration was criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and
        education indices in the state.[f]

    <p>
        Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election which gave the party a majority in the lower house of Indian
        parliament, the Lok Sabha, the first time for any single party since 1984. His administration has tried to raise
        foreign direct investment in the Indian economy and reduced spending on healthcare, education, and social
        welfare programmes. He centralised power by abolishing the Planning Commission and replacing it with the NITI
        Aayog. He began a high-profile sanitation campaign, controversially initiated a demonetisation of
        high-denomination banknotes and a transformation of the taxation regime, and weakened or abolished environmental
        high-denomination banknotes and a transformation of the taxation regime, and weakened or abolished environmental
        and labour laws. He oversaw the country's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As prime minister, he has received
        consistently high approval ratings.[

    <p>
        Under Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding.[15][16][g] Following his party's victory in
        the 2019 general election, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, introduced the
        Citizenship Amendment Act and three controversial farm laws, which prompted widespread protests and sit-ins
        across the country, resulting in a formal repeal of the latter. Described as engineering a political realignment
        towards right-wing politics, he remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu
        nationalist beliefs and handling of the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary
        social agenda.
